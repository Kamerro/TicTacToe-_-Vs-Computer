Enums!

In code I use Enums to mark if the player is the Cross or Circle. Same to the computer.
Of course we could use strings to mark sites, but the Enums are much more elegant :)

 Inheritance and why we use it? 
In code I create new control that inherit from Label. Label contain events and possibility for putting image into, so this is perfect choice for us!
Below in "Picture" section I put some screenshots of code, where the function is added to event "On Click" of created control.

How to generate controls in code ðŸ˜²? 
Simply, we need to declare the control, set the size, location and add the control into our Form. More in "Picture" section.

Computer behavior. How to check the cells?
We only need to check if the selected cell is empty or not. We can use 2D array of int/bool as grid. If we put something into cell, change the value in that place.
In code I use format [0] -> empty cell, [1] -> player cell, [-1] -> computer cell. If the cell is !=0 then we can put there something!
